## Part 2
<em>**Conditional**</em> Ruby conditional statements. Conditional statements are also known by the name of conditional processing or conditional expressions. They are used to perform a certain set of instructions if a specified condition is met. The conditions are generally of Boolean type and return either true or false as the result.<br>
<em>**The difference between if, elseif and else, is the difference between else and else if is that else doesn't need a condition as it is the default for everything where as else if is still an if so it needs a condition.**</em><br>
<em>**What are Case/When statements? </em>The CASE statement goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met (like an if-then-else statement). So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it returns the value in the ELSE clause.<br>
<em>**What is a data structure? </em>The data structure is a way that specifies how to organize and manipulate the data. It also defines the relationship between them. Some examples of Data Structures are arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue, etc.<rb>
<em>**Arrays**</em>Ruby arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. Each element in an array is associated with and referred to by an index. ... Ruby arrays can hold objects such as String, Integer, Fixnum, Hash, Symbol, even other Array objects. Ruby arrays are not as rigid as arrays in other languages.<br>
<em>**What is meant by 'built-in' methods?**</em>A method in Ruby is a set of expressions that returns a value. Within a method, you can organize your code into subroutines which can be easily invoked from other areas of their program. ... A method definition starts with the 'def' keyword followed by the method name.<br>
<em>**Loops**</em>Loops in Ruby are used to execute the same block of code a specified number of times. This chapter details all the loop statements supported by Ruby.<br>
<em>**What are infinite loops?**</em>An infinite loop is a sequence of instructions in a computer program which loops endlessly, either due to the loop having no terminating condition, having one that can never be met, or one that causes the loop to start over. ... Busy wait loops are also sometimes called "infinite loops".<br>
